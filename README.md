## Introduction

The project specification was to create an application using all elements of our training, including:

## Planning Resources

I used Jira to create a Kanban board to plan my project. I organised it into two sprints, one each for the front back ends of my project with multiple user stories for each as can be seen below:

I also utilized git to maintain a feature branch model. Below is my network for the front end:
